# Bigbraindle

Bigbraindle is a color guessing game where the player has to guess a sequence of four out of seven possible colors. After each guess the player is given a set of hints. A black dot means there is one color in the correct place and a white dot means there is a correct color but not in the correct spot of the sequence. The player has to identify which hint corresponds to which guessed color. No repeats or empty spots are possible.
